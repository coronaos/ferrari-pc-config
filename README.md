 Stop all processes and clean RAM
 
 These are two scripts that I've created to improve my trashcan acer computer with Debian 12 installed in it.
 
 cleaner_ram.sh-> cleans all the ram cache that is stored in
 stopec.sh-> one time script to stop and disable all the processes that I don't use, just to improve speed of my computer and stop wasting the enormous 743 Celeron power I've got, just kidding. It doesn't even let you watch a youtube video.
 
 As my teacher said the first day of my Network Management class:
 Sos ingeniero no jardinero, ten√©s que usar linux carajo.
